                        <!-- <p>Coming up with a truly great game idea is often the hardest part of the development journey.
                            It's a mix of creativity, market awareness, and brutal honesty about what's achievable. Many
                            developers, myself included, have ideas filled with half-baked concepts that never saw the
                            light of day. So, how do you break through the noise and find an idea worth pursuing?</p>

                        <div class="article-image-container">
                            <img class="article-image" src="./../../public/thumbnails/280725.png"
                                alt="Abstract image representing ideas">
                        </div>

                        <h2>What are the constraints?</h2>
                        <p>Instead of thinking about story or art style, start with a single, compelling action. What
                            does the player *do*? Is it jumping, building, talking, or something entirely new? A strong
                            core mechanic is the foundation of any good game. Think of games like 'Portal' (placing
                            portals) or 'Papers, Please' (checking documents). Their entire experience is built around
                            one simple, yet deeply engaging, action.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "The best mechanics are simple to understand but offer deep strategic possibilities. This is
                            the sweet spot you should be aiming for."
                        </blockquote>

                        <h2>Combine and Subvert Genres</h2>
                        <p>Sometimes the most innovative ideas come from smashing two existing genres together. What
                            happens when you mix a rhythm game with a first-person shooter? Or a dating sim with a
                            turn-based strategy game? This approach can lead to unique gameplay loops that feel both
                            familiar and fresh. Don't be afraid to experiment with unusual combinations.</p>

                        <h2>Prototyping in Blueprints</h2>
                        <p>Before you commit to months of C++ development, use Unreal Engine's Blueprints to rapidly
                            prototype your core mechanic. The goal here isn't to make something pretty; it's to answer
                            one question: "Is this fun?" Here’s a simple example of a Blueprint node setup for a basic
                            dash mechanic:</p>

                        <pre><code>// This is a simplified representation of Blueprint logic
Event Tick  Branch (Is Dashing?) 
    True: Set Actor Location (New Location = Current Location + Forward Vector * Dash Speed)
    False: Do Nothing
                    </code></pre>

                        <p>This simple test can tell you more about your game idea in an hour than a week of writing
                            design documents. If the core action feels good even with simple cubes, you might be onto
                            something. If it's a chore, it's better to find out early and pivot to a new idea.</p> -->

                        <p>While we all dream of making the next million-dollar indie game, we often overlook the
                            importance of feasibility. It's crucial to ask ourselves: <b>Can I actually finish this
                                game?</b> Many developers who overlook this question find themselves stuck in an endless
                            cycle of development without a clear path to completion, which we call <b>development
                                hell</b>.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "The best game ideas are the ones you can actually finish. Don't get lost in the dream of a
                            perfect game; focus on what you can realistically achieve."
                        </blockquote>

                        <h2>How It Started</h2>
                        <p>After completing a game development course, I faced my first challenge: creating projects to
                            apply what I'd learned and showcase my skills to potential employers. For that, I was
                            advised to create as many small games as possible, be they hyper-casual or clones. But I
                            didn't agree with them; I didn't want to make something even I wouldn't play.</p>
                        <p>Now, I also had plenty of ideas for next-gen, groundbreaking game lore and mechanics, but
                            let's be real. It's not something I could do alone in a short period. It would take years
                            and might never even see the light of day.</p>
                        <p>So, I had to make a choice: scale down my ambitions. The best approach is to <b>start
                                small</b>. I set some constraints: I needed to finish it in a week, and it shouldn't be
                            an art-demanding game, as I'm a programmer before anything else. Now, the easy answer was to
                            ask <b>ChatGPT</b>, right? That's what I tried. It gave me a bunch of game ideas that fit my
                            constraints, but I honestly didn't like any of them. Yet, I kept the very first one just
                            because it was the first one xD. It was a platformer, exactly like <i><a
                                    href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marvellous.NinJump&hl=en_IN&pli=1"
                                    target="_blank">NinJump</a></i>,
                            but without the ninja.</p>
                        <p>It wasn't what I wanted, but after several hours of getting nowhere, it just clicked: what if
                            instead of the player jumping to another wall, the world itself changed its orientation? And
                            that's how <b>The Gravity Flip</b> was born.</p>

                        <div class="article-image-container">
                            <img class="article-image" src="https://kalpshah.dev/public/tgf-main.png"
                                alt="Abstract image representing ideas">
                        </div>

                        <p>While making The Gravity Flip, a puzzle platformer, I recalled a statement from <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK" target="_blank"><b><abbr
                                        title="Game Maker's Toolkit">GMTK</abbr></b></a>: "Making puzzles is hard." You
                            have to make sure the puzzle is challenging enough, yet still solvable. One thing developers
                            often overlook is that a puzzle they think is very easy can turn out to be very difficult
                            for players. Managing all that is quite difficult. And yet, it turned out to be a pretty
                            good game with <b>very positive reviews</b>. You can read the reviews <a
                                href="https://kalpshah.dev/pages/projectdetails.html?project=tgf"
                                target="_blank">here</a>, and if you want to try the game, you can play it <a
                                href="https://kryoxx-studio.itch.io/the-gravity-flip" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                        <h2>The Real Challenge Begins</h2>
                        <p>Now, after completing The Gravity Flip, the real challenge began. The idea for The Gravity
                            Flip had come to me out of nowhere, and that doesn't happen every time. This time, I spent
                            days and days thinking of a new game idea, but I couldn't come up with anything.</p>
                        <p>The moment I thought of an idea, I would end up expanding it more and more, to the point
                            where it was no longer achievable within my time constraints. This <b>scope creep</b> would
                            eventually lead to <b>development hell</b>.</p>
                        <p>One of the ideas was <b>very cool</b>: a robot on a spaceship with no internal battery,
                            needing a constant power supply from a wire. However, designing puzzles around the
                            constraint of a non-extendable wire was hard. I couldn't come up with puzzles that presented
                            both a clear challenge and a solution. I spent several days trying to iterate on that idea
                            and design some puzzles, but I still couldn't make it work. The right call was to <b>scrap
                                that idea</b> or adapt it in another way.</p>
                        <p>This was my approach for a puzzle game, but what if the next idea wasn't a puzzle? What if it
                            depended heavily on character movement? How do we know if it's worth committing to? That's
                            what we'll see in the next segment.</p>

                        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                        <p>Prototyping is the process of creating the bare minimum of the final product, excluding all
                            the fancy graphics, music, and art. It's not supposed to be a gorgeous game; it's most
                            likely just some blocks moving around, executing the bare minimum of your <b>core
                                mechanic</b> so you can find out how the game <b>feels</b>.</p>
                        <p>This is a crucial part, as it tells you how the game feels. Even if you pour your heart and
                            soul into making gorgeous graphics and amazing music, if the core gameplay isn't fun, the
                            game won't succeed. It simply won't provide the <b>Fun</b>. This is where many games
                            fail—they just aren't fun. Developers keep working on them, thinking that better graphics or
                            music will eventually make the game fun, but that rarely happens. The purpose of a prototype
                            is to determine if your core idea is fun and to know when to stop, as the saying goes:</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            Test Fast, Fail Fast, Adjust Fast
                        </blockquote>

                        <h2>What If We Still Don't Get an Idea?</h2>
                        <p><b>Play more games</b>, especially in the genre and scope you're aiming for. Try mixing
                            various genres to see if you can create a new gem.</p>

                        <h2>Personal Extras</h2>
                        <p>The Gravity Flip was very positively received, which I feel quite lucky about. I didn't
                            expect people to like it that much. I didn't market it, so there wasn't a big audience, but
                            the people I had try the game all liked it very much.</p>
                        <p>One more thing to note: the levels I created, thinking they were easy, players found to be
                            quite hard. This reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK"><b><abbr
                                        title="Game Maker's Toolkit">GMTK's</abbr></b></a> remarks about puzzle design
                            in one of his devlogs.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Game design skill comes with <b>experience</b>. You can't expect to make good games right
                            away. There's a saying that
                        <blockquote>Your first few games are going to fail,</blockquote> but the key is to make sure you
                        <b>fail forward</b>. Learn from those failures, improve continuously, keep making games, and
                        eventually, you will be a great game designer. <b>I wish you all the best!</b></p>
